### Ginga CC WebServices


This project is a partial implementation of Ginga CC WebServices for the TV 3.0 Project.

Ginga CC WebServices APIs are specified in ABNT NBR 15606-11. However, only APIs applicable
to TV 3.0 use case prototypes are included in this project.

It is forked from a UFJF prototyping effort targeted at use cases involving the support
for a decoupled media player. This approach will be useful for supporting different licenses
between the Ginga runtime engines and the media player, as well as in the context of
application switching.

Initial files structure and source code created from [Node Express GitLab template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/express).
